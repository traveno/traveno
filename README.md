Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stephen, an Angular/SvelteKit web developer with a passion for crafting intuitive and engaging user experiences. I love diving into the world of 3D technologies, with a special focus on CAD. Whether it's designing, building, or experimenting with new ideas, I thrive on creativity and innovation.

In my free time, you'll find me building custom 3D printers, exploring new recipes in the kitchen, or embarking on adventures to discover something new. Let's connect and create something amazing together! ðŸš€
